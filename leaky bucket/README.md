Problem Statement :-
Write a program for congestion control using Leaky Bucket algorithm.

The leaky Bucket Algorithm which is one of the congestion control used in Networking So by using this algortihm we have written a program in Java to show how the leaky bucket algorithm concept works.

The Main logic function of the program is showed below in the image.
